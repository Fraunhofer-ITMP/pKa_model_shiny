# FhG pKa model

This is a repository of the FhG-ITMP ADME models for pKa using the [Czodorowski dataset](https://github.com/czodrowskilab/Machine-learning-meets-pKa).

* To test the model on a new data set, a dataset with ECFP4 fingerprints is required. Ensure that the columns are labelled with the prefix "ECFP4_" as shown below.
